The raven soars upon the northern winds of winter,
And on through the seasons, progressing onward
To see spring rains dawn upon the land with fern and flower,
The fiery southern sun of summer lighting the land,
And comes to rest on the great tree of the earth 
As the sun sets upon the year, ready for renewal.

[N: Raven, E: Flower, S: Sun, W: Tree]
