Things still needed for my RPG framework

Major Systems:

    1. FIX BROKEN HOTBAR!!!
    2. Dialogue System
    3. Quest System
    4. XP and Leveling
    5. Merchants (Buying / Selling)


Small Additions & Fixes:

    1. Wands / Staves
    2. Wearable Armor (becomes major-ish if visible on character)
    3. Wearable Magic Items (rings, amulets); these work with the status effect system
    4. Working Settings/Options and Help/Info screens (major importance but should not be hard)
    5. Beds, sleeping, and down time mechanic


...anything more should be cut from systems.

Fixing the hotbar is essential.  Apparently I didn't break it recently, it was bugged all along.  Its good
as long as you aren't switching between one and two handed items; the problem was not obvious before adding
the bow because there were no two handed items.  Trying to band-aid it did work.  What probably needs to be
done is to separate uneqipping of previous items from equipping of new.  Everything works to equip/unequip
an item on its own.  What I should probably do is, when equipping an item first search the hotbar for
anything sharing at least one hand that is already equipped; if any are found, activate them as though
their hotkeys were pressed to unequip them.  Once all items sharing a hand have been equipped then continue
with equipping the selected item.  Hopefully this will fix the problem.

Beyond that is creating an actual game, at least a demo or “vertical slice.”  For this I need to: Make items,
make properly done containers, make spells, write AI for specific actions / creatures / characters, build a
village, make villagers and other friendly NPCs, make monsters and enemies, furnish and add encounters to
Castle van Webb, design and build a second dungeon (yes, I want a second, bigger, one on the text village map).
Unfortunately, while the coding can get frustrating, these tasks are already seeming horribly tedious (and I’ve
barely started); this is where I start to question if I really want to do this.


(Not part of the main framework, probably, but need to save and load weather data.)
