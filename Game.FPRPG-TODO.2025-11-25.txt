Things still needed for my RPG framework

Major Systems:

    1. Dialogue System
    2. Quest System
    3. XP and Leveling
    4. Merchants (Buying / Selling)


Small Additions & Fixes:

    1. Tool Tips for Stats
    2. Archery (and Thrown Weapons?)
    3. Wands / Staves
    4. Wearable Armor (becomes major-ish if visible on character)
    5. Wearable Magic Items (rings, amulets); these work with the status effect system
    6. Maybe: System to make some (negative) status effects (e.g, poison) not aggressively stack
    7. Probably: Choice of Male of Female Avatar (in lieu of true/full avatar customization)
    8. Working Settings/Options and Help/Info screens (major importance but should not be hard)


...anything more should be cut from systems.

Beyond that is creating an actual game, at least a demo or “vertical slice.”  For this I need to: Make items,
make properly done containers, make spells, write AI for specific actions / creatures / characters, build a
village, make villagers and other friendly NPCs, make monsters and enemies, furnish and add encounters to
Castle van Webb, design and build a second dungeon (yes, I want a second, bigger, one on the text village map).
Unfortunately, while the coding can get frustrating, these tasks are already seeming horribly tedious (and I’ve
barely started); this is where I start to question if I really want to do this.
