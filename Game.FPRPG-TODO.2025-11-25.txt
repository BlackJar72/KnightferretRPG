Things still needed for my RPG framework

Major Systems:

    1. Dialogue System
    2. Quest System
    3. XP and Leveling
    4. Merchants (Buying / Selling)
    5. Character Avatar Customization


Small Additions & Fixes:

    1. Archery (and Thrown Weapons?)
    2. Wands / Staves
    3. Wearable Armor (becomes major-ish if visible on character)
    4. Wearable Magic Items (rings, amulets); these work with the status effect system
    5. Maybe: System to make some (negative) status effects (e.g, poison) not aggressively stack
    6. Working Settings/Options and Help/Info screens (major importance but should not be hard)
    7. Beds, sleeping, and down time mechanic


...anything more should be cut from systems.

Beyond that is creating an actual game, at least a demo or “vertical slice.”  For this I need to: Make items,
make properly done containers, make spells, write AI for specific actions / creatures / characters, build a
village, make villagers and other friendly NPCs, make monsters and enemies, furnish and add encounters to
Castle van Webb, design and build a second dungeon (yes, I want a second, bigger, one on the text village map).
Unfortunately, while the coding can get frustrating, these tasks are already seeming horribly tedious (and I’ve
barely started); this is where I start to question if I really want to do this.


(Not part of the main framework, probably, but need to save and load weather data.)
